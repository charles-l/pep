* remove copy paste buffer and use xsel
* make insert mode work
    * fix newline in middle of line
    * fix delete in middle of line (on text that wasn't in current insert)
* make undo work
    * handle multi-line deletion

* add yanking
* start eating your dogfood boi
* fix multiple buffers
* pipe out to tmux for layout
* make motions passable as structs of some sort
* see if it's possible to pipe out syntax highlighting ;)
